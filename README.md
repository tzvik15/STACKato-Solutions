# Portfolio, Music Theory Games

## Overview
My developer portfolio, as well as the homepage for Music Theory Games, all built with React.js 

### Functionality
The user can navigate between 4 main areas: an about me page, a contact page, a portfolio page, and the Music Theory Games suite of applications. The about page includes several paragraphs about my history and passion, as well as a listing of my technical knowledges. The contact page contains my contact information, as well as a working contact form that, upon submission, sends me an email with the contents. The portfolio page contains several projects I worked on. Hovering on a project name opens a short description of it, and clicking on the project name links to a page discussing the project in more detail, including links to its repo and deployed URL. The Music Theory Games area holds the (currently) 2 applications in the suite.

## Music Theory Games
A suite of applications (currently 2), each dealing with a different topic in music theory. These applications are targeted at middle-school aged children (but can be used by older students as well). They are simple, colorful, and follow a similar UX/UI pattern where users can learn about the topic, or play with their knowledge.

### Technology Used
React.js (functional, using hooks), react-router, useSound external module.
