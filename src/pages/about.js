          test Hello everyone, and thank you for visiting my developer site! In this
          section I will tell you a little about myself, my history, and the
          work I've done and hoping to do.
        </p>
        <p className="break" id="pTwo">
          Let's start with the basics of my background. My formal studies were
          in the fields of music and education (I have a doctorate in
          performance and pedagogy!) I grew up in Israel, where I did my
          undergrad, and later moved to Los Angeles and finally to Colorado for
          my graduate work.
        </p>
        <p className="break" id="pThree">
          It was here in Colorado that I learned how important collaboration is
          to me. In fact, the concept is so meaningful for me that I wrote my
          doctoral thesis on the subject!
        </p>

        <p className="break" id="pFour">
          I took my first steps as a developer at the University of Denver,
          where I immedietly began encorporating my thoughts and ideas on
          collaborative work into my studies, collaborating on projects, and
          working with my cohort members to help and support each other in our
          journey as developers.
        </p>
        <p className="break" id="pFive">
          As a developer, I am passionate about using JavaScript to find
          creative solutions to coding challenges. An example of my JS can be
          seen in my "Bone'z Beatz" project, where I used JS to connect
          dynamically between sound files and key strokes, creating a fully
          custumizable soundboard application. (more about this project{" "}
